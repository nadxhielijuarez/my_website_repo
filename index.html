	<h1>About</h1><br>
	<h1 class="MeTxt"> Me </h1>
</div>

<div class = "intro" >I am currently an aspiring software developer, studying Computer Engineering at Texas A&M, with an interest in software development.<br> <br>	
Life Philosophy: Life is about making the best of the time and place you find yourself in to continue to progress forward.<br>
My interests and hobbies can be summed with: being involved in my community, carpentry, art (painting), web-development, entrepreneurship, self-development. <br> 
In sum, my friends would describe me as ambitious, kind, and driven. <br>

<br>

What draws me to the world of tech, is a desire to help others, I love that technology simplifies our lives, and want to be part of that. Of the existing tech fields, <br>
I feel that the simplest way to reach and assist as many people as possible, can best be achieved through some sort of application or software, since so much of what <br>
 we do revolves around software. <br>
 <br>
It is for this reason that I am drawn to companies with a user-oriented culture. I hope to contribute to a product that can assist the lives of many on a daily basis. <br>
hope to take part of a team that actively keeps the user experience in mind.<br>
I also hope to continue to grow my technical skill set well after my time in college, and for this reason I hope to end up at a company with plenty technical growth opportunities. <br>
I also hope to have some degree of work life balance so that I can work on my other related hobbies and interests, like carpentry, and entrepreneurship.  <br>


In the future I would like to continue to work towards impacting the community I find myself in some impactful way. <br> 
Currently through AHICS, I can work towards creating a more welcoming environment for Hispanics in computing related fields and am able to share my passion for my culture. <br>
 Previously, in high school I worked towards increasing educational opportunities for my classmates, and in the beginning of my college career I took part in initiatives <br> 
 related to increasing educational opportunities, like SWE Inspire, and Aggie STEM. In the future I would like to put together a scholarship fund for my high school and  <br>
 other underprivileged communities like it.
